# Console-Finances

## My fourth challenge with the edX Bootcamp

I completed this task for the fourth challenge in my Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. I was tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I was provided with a financial dataset in the starter code and I wrote JavaScript code to calculate various mathematical operations to analyse the data. This task aimed to use the JavaScript skills I had learned during the week.  I declared variables, used if conditional statements and for loops. 

## Usage
Click on inspect on the web browser and then open the console to see the data analysed. Below is a link to the screenshot that shows the console in action:

## Acknowledgements

I used the slack forums and code academy to help me understand how to target data in a nested array. I used chat GPT to help me understand how to use a for loop to calculate the greatest increase in profits. I then adapted this code to write the greatest decrease in profit code.
